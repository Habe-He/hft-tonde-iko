                                <h3>Zack Alvarado</h3>
<p>Zack is a high school student that loves making pixel art. He started out making art and levels for imaginary games with Paint.NET, and later creating custom skins for Minecraft. Then he started making real games with his older brother, Indigo, who did the programming in BlitzMax.  He spent many, many hours studying and practicing the craft of making tile sets and animating characters for 2D games.</p>
<p>He eventually started programming his own 2D platform game so he wouldn’t have to wait on his brother to implement the features he wanted. But his first love is making pixel art, and he was happy to have the chance to work on the tile sets and design ideas for Tonde Iko—a game that would be publicly exhibited!</p>
<p>He plans to keep developing his art skills and working as a professional game developer in the future.</p>

                                <p>Gregg has been making games since the early 80s starting back in high school with John Alvarado. His first commerical game was
                                Centipede for the Commodore 64. The most famous games he's worked on are probably
                                Gunship for C64/PC/Amiga, Pirates! for PC, and <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=crash+team+racing">Crash Team Racing</a> for PS1. He had
                                the most fun making <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=locoroco">Locoroco</a> for PSP.</p>
                                <p>Lately he's been spending his time making the <a href="http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes">HappyFunTimes system</a> and
                                trying to explore the possibilities that are enabled when you can have
                                a local game with 10-50 players.</p>
                                <p>He's also hanging out as an "artist in residence" at the <a href="http://games.ucla.edu">UCLA Game Lab</a>
                                where he's helping students use HappyFunTimes.</p>
