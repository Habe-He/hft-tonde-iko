To Do
=====

*   Make name persist across machines
*   Set and define destinations
*   Make end that disconnects you
*   Make queue to get into the game

    This way we can throttle players? Do we need this?
    Maybe have a countdown on the phone when you'll get
    inserted

*   Add doors and switches that work by proximity

    if 1 player is in area of door for 10+ seconds door opens
    if 2 players are in larger area of door door requires switch

*   Make debug launch

    Displays debug info

*   Make calibrator

    Figure out how to persist calibration

*   Make launcher

    Figure out how to start multiple machines? ssh? cygwin?

*   Make version that plays locally. Use < 1.0 scale to fit on screen
